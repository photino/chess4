  An introduction to our game can be found <a href="doc/chess4.pdf">here</a>.
  The board consists of 144 squares (tweleve columns and tweleve rows) arranged 
  in two alternating colors. The game is played as if the chessboard was a torus,
  with the left side joined to the right side and the top side joined to the bottom side. 
  This means that there is no edge on the side of the board. When a piece goes off
  the left (top) edge, it reappears on the right (bottom) edge, and vice versa. 
  Each player starts with the same chess pieces as the standard chess game.
  Now, you may have a try <a href="play.html">online</a>.
